    <h3>Whats the difference between gelato and ice cream?</h3>
    <p><em>Gelato</em> is a luscious Italian frozen dessert with less fat and air than traditional <em>ice cream,</em> resulting in a richer, denser texture and more vibrant flavors.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean or 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Vanilla Base:</strong> In a medium saucepan, combine the whole milk and heavy cream. If you're using a vanilla bean, split it lengthwise, scrape the seeds, and add both the seeds and the bean to the milk mixture. If using vanilla extract, you'll add it later.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat the Mixture:</strong> Heat the milk and cream mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Bring it to a gentle simmer, but do not let it boil. Remove it from the heat once it starts to steam.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the Egg Yolks:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar together until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thick.</li>
            <li><strong>Temper the Eggs:</strong> Gradually pour the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture while whisking constantly. This tempers the eggs, preventing them from curdling.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Custard:</strong> Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan. If you're using vanilla extract, add it at this point. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170°F or 77°C). Do not let it boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain and Chill:</strong> Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. This removes any bits of vanilla bean and ensures a smooth texture. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 4 hours or until it's thoroughly chilled.</li>
            <li><strong>Churn the Gelato:</strong> Pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. This typically takes about 20-25 minutes, or until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer and Freeze:</strong> Transfer the churned gelato to an airtight container and freeze it for an additional 2-3 hours or until it's firm.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Scoop the gelato into bowls or cones, and savor the creamy, rich, and delightful flavor of classic vanilla gelato.</li>
        </ol>
