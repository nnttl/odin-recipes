    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em><strong>Italian</strong></em> pizza is a globally beloved dish characterized by a thin, crispy crust topped with flavorful tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and a variety of toppings ranging from vegetables and meats to herbs and olive oil. It's renowned for its simple yet harmonious flavor combinations and is traditionally baked in wood-fired ovens, resulting in a delightful culinary experience.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Best Homemade Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Best Basil Pesto or Basil Cashew Pesto</li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the pizza dough:</strong> (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest).</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the pizza sauce:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sauté the garlic and onion until they become soft and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes to the saucepan. If you're using garlic and onion powder, simply add them to the tomatoes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the dried oregano, sugar, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer. Allow it to cook for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally to meld the flavors and thicken the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings if needed. You can add more sugar for sweetness or more oregano for flavor, depending on your preferences.</li>
                    <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the pizza:</strong>When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle;</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
            <li>Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
